# ThumbsUp! Keyboard 3D-Printed Parts

This is a collection of the ThumbsUp! keyboard 3D-printed parts: cases, switch plates and keycaps.

Cases are fully optional as they have little functional benefits, may be some keyboard protection during the transportation, but otherwise they are not needed, keyboard were designed to have "naked" PCBs.

Switch plates are rather necessary.
Switches around the edges of the board are prone to rocking and being pulled out from the sockets.
These plates prevent that and incidentally allow usage of 5-pin MX switches.
For ALPS (or their Matias version) plates also align the switches, compensating for the lack of additional pins in those switches.
